// what we will do is count all the edges. 
// then count all the vertex as well.
// run a loop from 1 to no_of_vertex-1. then update the shortest distance.
// maintain a shortest distance array as well.
// now after iterating for no_of_vertex-1, do one more iteration to check for negative cycle. 
// return the shortest path from one node to other nodes.
