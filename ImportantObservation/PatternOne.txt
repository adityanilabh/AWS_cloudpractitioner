For sequence were we have to find longest Increasing subsequence,
 and we have to avoid counting elements that are part of that sequence, we can use this
 pattern: 

 for (int num : nums) {
    // important line.
            if (!set.contains(num - 1)) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int currentStreak = 1;

                while (set.contains(currentNum + 1)) {
                    currentNum++;
                    currentStreak++;
                }

                longestStreak = Math.max(longestStreak, currentStreak);
            }
        },
 
-- in line number 7, we just don't consider any element which are intermediate of a 
   sequence.
