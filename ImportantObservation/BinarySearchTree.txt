1.  Inorder traversal: In case of binary search trees (BST), 
Inorder traversal gives nodes in non-decreasing order.

2.  Preorder traversal:It is used to create a copy of the tree. 
Preorder traversal is also used to get prefix expression on of an expression tree.

3.Postorder traversal: Postorder traversal first traverses the left and the right 
subtree and then visits the root node. It is used to delete the tree. In simple words, 
visit the root of every subtree last.

4.Level order traversal: Level order traversal of a BST is breadth first traversal 
for the tree. It visits all nodes at a particular level first before moving to the 
next level.

5.Height of BST: It is recursively calculated using height of left and right 
subtrees of the node and assigns height to the node as max of the heights of two 
children plus 1.

6. Delete a Node of BST: It is used to delete a node with specific key from the 
BST and return the new BST.
